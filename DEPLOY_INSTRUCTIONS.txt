ASSISTANT MEMORIAL EDITION - DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Your application is ready to deploy! Follow these steps to get it live on Railway.

STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY
================================================================================

Option A: Create a new GitHub repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "assistant-revival"
3. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

Option B: Use an existing repository
- You can push to any GitHub repository you own

STEP 2: PUSH YOUR CODE TO GITHUB
================================================================================

From the assistant-revival directory, run:

  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/assistant-revival.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

STEP 3: DEPLOY TO RAILWAY
================================================================================

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Login" and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" button
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Find and select your "assistant-revival" repository
6. Railway will automatically detect the Node.js project
7. Click "Deploy"

Railway will now:
- Clone your repository
- Install dependencies
- Build the application
- Deploy it live

This takes about 2-5 minutes.

STEP 4: CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
================================================================================

Once deployed, you need to set environment variables:

1. In Railway dashboard, click on your project
2. Go to the "Variables" tab
3. Add these variables:

   NODE_ENV = production
   PORT = 5000
   AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY = [your OpenAI API key]
   AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL = https://api.replit.com/openai/v1

4. Click "Save"

The application will automatically redeploy with these variables.

STEP 5: ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION
================================================================================

After deployment completes:

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab in Railway
2. You'll see a URL like: https://assistant-revival-production.railway.app
3. Click the URL to open your application
4. Your Assistant Memorial Edition is now live!

STEP 6: OPTIONAL - SET UP CUSTOM DOMAIN
================================================================================

To use your own domain (e.g., assistant.yoursite.com):

1. In Railway, go to "Settings" tab
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Railway will show you DNS records to add
5. Update your domain's DNS settings
6. Wait for DNS to propagate (usually 5-30 minutes)
